# üî•RoseView (v0.1.9)

Roseview is a client side framework, designed to simplify the creation of single page applications and mulitipage applications. Roseview uses the android model and mixes it with the html model.

- RoseView uses the concept of layouts
- RoseView uses hashbased routing for quicker navigation and file based routing for views with many elements

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can also install roseview in node by :

`npm install roseview`,

After that the next step is to use the cli tool to create a new project.

`create-rose-app appName`

In your projects dont forget to import : )

```javascript
import { html, cssParser } from 'roseview'
```

---


### The Concept Of Layouts

A layout is a special div that takes in parameters like the hash route, type of layout, alignment options.

```javascript
let main = html.CreateLayout(type, alignmentOptions);


let main = html.CreateLayout("linear", "center, scrolly, fillxy");
````

The option "FillXY", is useful for fullscreen layouts, layouts can be created to form a toast, banner, bottomsheet.

#### Types Of Layouts & Alignment Options

The main type of layouts is a linear one, if you want to position elements anywhere use an absolute layout

Alignment options available are :

- center / vcenter (vertically centerd)
- left / right
- noscrollbar
- bottom / top
- filly / fillx / fillxy
- horizontal / vertical
- scrolly / scrollx / scrollxy

### Then Everything Else

The `html` object has many available html elements (Buttons / Images) which are exposed after adding the '.'

```javascript
html.Button
html.Image
````

However if the html element you want to use is not available or you are using special tags, use this :

```javascript
html.Element(parent, HTMLELEMENT)
```

All functions of this object take in the first parameter as the parent, basically the layout they must attach to, then the following parameters are exposed through the lsp (jsDOC also available).

### Page Routing

For now roseview supports only hash based routing which is still buggy but a fix is being deployed.

The first parameter of layouts is the hash route therefore they can be added in this manner :

```javascript
// Main Testing Script For roseview Features

import { HashRouter } from "roseview";
import { createApp } from "roseview";

import main from "./pages/main.js";
import about from "./pages/about.js";

const routes = [
    { path: "index", component: main },
    { path: "about", component: about },
];
const router = HashRouter(routes);

window.app = createApp(main).use(router).mount("#app");

```

In your main.js page you would have something like this :

```javascript
import { html } from "roseview";

let main = html.CreateLayout("linear", "center, scrolly, fillxy");

let btn = html.Button(main, "Go To About üòã");

btn.on("click", function () {
    app.router.navigate("about");
});

export default main;
```

### Styling Elements

To style your elements use the `.style` method which takes in an object and converts it into a style.

```javascript
txt.style({
   position: "relative",
   lineHeight : "18px",

   "&:active": {
    boxShadow: "0px, 0px, 0px, 0px",
    top: "5px",
    left: "5px"
   }

   "*" : {
    color: "red"
   }
})
```

#### Adding Classes

If you want to add classes use :

```javascript
btn.classes = 'class1 classB classH'
// To Remove
btn.removeClasses = 'class1'
```

#### DX Improvements

There is the `setMargins / setChildMargins / setPosition` getters which allow you to change spacing without editing css directly.

```javascript
let main = html.CreateLayout("linear", "center, scrolly, fillxy");
main.setChildMargins = "null, 15px";
````

Additionally to modify properties without adding stress to the DOM use the `batchProps` method which takes in an object of modifications and uses `requestAnimationFrame`.

```javascript
btn.props({
textContent : 'Hi',
style.color : 'red'
})
```

#### Element Control

##### Show / Gone

These are getters set true to comply with function condition
Gone make the elements hide and not visible while not taking space.

##### On

This is an event listener method, use as

```javascript
let loginBtn = html.Button(main, "Open Login Page");

loginBtn.on("click", () => {
 alert('Logged In')
});
```

##### bindInput

This method binds a signal (where input is) to where input is displayed at.

##### addChild / destroyChild

If you want to add an element as a child of another use addChild, then to destroy the element use destroyChild.

### Accesing DOM Methods

To use the  available javascript methods add 'element' to the caller.

````javascript
btn.element.textContent = 'DOM Access'
````

### Achieving Reactivity

- signals

- showIF

Check This Page:

- [Reactivity Docs](docs/Reactivity.md)

All that is the barebones needed to get started with the framework.
